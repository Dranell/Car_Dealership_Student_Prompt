The purpose of this application is to build a database using the language of Python in unison with MySql for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD Operations) information for a Car Dealership. The database will be comprised of three tables relating to a directory of employees at the dealership, sports cars that are the dealership sells, and sedans the dealership has. A relational database will be used to help structure and organize the different branches of information to be categorized and Python will be used for efficiency in building the database with all information.
